This project is for the code+ full stack developer course with the Learning People. It is my portfolio page website and it aims to give people and potential employers an insight on my life and why I am a good software developer. I will improve the website slowly as I learn more. At the moment the website only uses CSS and HTML, Bootstrap was used for most of the styling. Some of the code I used came from different youtube tutorials but it was tweaked to suit my ideas.
The following re the urls of the tutorials I used.
